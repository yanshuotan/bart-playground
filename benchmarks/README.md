  - [stochtree](https://github.com/StochasticTree/stochtree)  
  - [bartz](https://github.com/Gattocrucco/bartz)

- **Traditional ensemble methods:**  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost

The benchmarks focus on evaluating predictive accuracy, uncertainty quantification (prediction intervals), and runtime across different datasets.
